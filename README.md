# ElytraThermals
Minecraft plugin

This project was created to provide the following features when gliding with Elytra:

-When gliding over heat sources (within distance and above a horizontal velocity), provide temporary lift.
-When gliding under cold sources (within distance and above a horizontal velocity), provide temporary drag.
-While gliding, provide an altimeter and speedometer as BossBars.
-When gliding above a specified height, inflict minor suffocation damage.
-When gliding and pressing crouch, provide aerodynamic braking (mainly horizontal with limited vertical).
